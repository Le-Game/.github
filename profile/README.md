# 🎮 CodeFiasco Studios 🤪

Welcome to the whimsically wonky world of CodeFiasco Studios - where our code is as buggy as our game concepts, and our art is, well, let's call it "abstract"! 

## Meet Our Chaotically Charming Team 🌪️

### **Aleks "Array Assassin" Pertise**
- **Role:** Accidental Bug Creator (and sometimes programmer)
- **Favorite Language:** Segmentation fault... I mean c++
- **Fun Fact:** Can turn any functional code into an enigma wrapped in a riddle.

### **Helle "Loop Lunatic" Kopter**
- **Role:** Infinite Loop Creator
- **Favorite Language:** Python (but only with extra bugs)
- **Fun Fact:** Dreams in code, wakes up to find none of it works.

## Our Unhinged Undertaking 🌌
"To make playable spaghetti code."

## Current "Masterpiece": "The Quest for the Missing Semicolon" 🐛
- **Status:** What's a status? We're making it up as we go!
- **Expected Release:** Hopefully before the sun explodes
- **Description:** An adventure game where you're lost in a maze of code, seeking the mythical missing semicolon.

## Developer's Diary: Chronicles of Catastrophe 📚
- **Week 1:** Created our first character! It's a triangle. We call him Bob.
- **Week 2:** Bob now has a friend - a slightly smaller triangle. We're calling this one 'Art.'
- **Week 3:** Tried 3D rendering. Ended up with a 2D existential crisis.
